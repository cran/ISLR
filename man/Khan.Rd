\description{The data consists of a
  number of tissue samples corresponding to four distinct types of small
  round blue cell tumors. For each tissue sample, 2308 gene expression measurements are available.

\format{
  The format is a list containing four components: \code{xtrain},
  \code{xtest}, \code{ytrain}, and \code{ytest}. \code{xtrain} contains
  the 2308 gene expression values for 63 subjects and \code{ytrain}
  records the corresponding tumor type. \code{ytrain} and \code{ytest}
  contain the corresponding testing sample information for a further 20 subjects.
